        "summary": `After Japan’s disappointing 2018 World Cup exit, Anri Teieri, a new member of the Japan Football Union, criticizes the team’s lack of progress and proposes a new plan to revolutionize Japanese soccer. Despite mockery from Chairman Hirotoshi Buratsuta, who only cares about profits, Anri insists Japan can win the World Cup with the right approach. She introduces Jinpachi Ego, a coach with an extreme vision — to create the ultimate striker. At the same time, in the Saitama High School Finals, Yoichi Isagi from Ichinan High loses a crucial match after passing the ball instead of taking the winning shot. His team misses the chance to reach the Nationals, and Isagi is crushed, wondering if he made the wrong choice. That night, he reflects on his idol, Noel Noa, and dreams of leading Japan to glory — though that dream feels far away. Soon, Isagi receives a letter from the Japan Football Union inviting him to a “Special Player Training Program.” Excited and confused, he attends the meeting and meets Ryosuke Kira, a top high school forward who praises Isagi’s game sense. Inside, they’re greeted by Jinpachi Ego, who announces that they are among Japan’s top 300 U-18 forwards — all chosen for his new experiment called Blue Lock. Ego declares that Japan needs a striker who plays with selfishness and hunger for goals — someone with an unshakable ego. He argues that teamwork and selflessness have limited Japan’s potential, and only a true egoist can become the best striker in the world. His words shock many players, especially Kira, who believes soccer is about teamwork. But when Ego challenges them to step up, Isagi, torn between doubt and excitement, runs forward, declaring his desire to join. His action sparks the rest to follow, officially marking the start of Blue Lock — a program designed to forge one world-class striker out of 300 hopefuls.`

        "summary": `On the way to the Blue Lock facility, Yoichi Isagi rides a bus, filled with both excitement and nerves. Upon arrival, Anri Teieri gives every player a uniform with a number and letter—Isagi receives #299, Team Z, meaning he’s ranked near the bottom. Inside his dorm room, he meets Ryosuke Kira, who’s glad to see a familiar face, and Gurimu Igarashi, a clumsy player who accidentally throws a shirt at Isagi. Igarashi, a second-year forward from a temple, explains that if he doesn’t become a pro, he’ll have to return and become a monk. Suddenly, Jinpachi Ego appears on a screen and explains the system: the numbers represent each player’s ranking out of 300, which will rise or fall based on performance. Only the top five players will qualify for Japan’s U-20 National Team, while those eliminated will lose their chance to ever play for Japan again. Ego then announces their first challenge — a 136-second game of “Tag” where the player holding the ball when time runs out will be immediately expelled from Blue Lock. The game begins with Igarashi, ranked lowest, as “it.” Panicking, he tries to hit Isagi but fails. The others run and dodge desperately, realizing this is no ordinary tag. Kira criticizes the test, saying it’s not real football, but Ego’s words echo in their minds about egoism and risk. Chaos erupts when another player, Rensuke Kunigami (#291), becomes “it.” Isagi gets caught in the crossfire and takes a hard shot to the stomach. 
        With only seconds left, Isagi becomes the new “it.” He considers tagging Igarashi, who’s injured, but hesitates—doing so would crush the boy’s dreams. Instead, he decides to go after someone stronger. At that moment, Meguru Bachira (#290) steals the ball and attacks Kira, hitting him in the face just as the timer ends. The game stops, and Kira is declared eliminated. Furious, Kira confronts Ego, saying the test is meaningless. Ego calmly explains that the room’s size matches a real penalty area—where 75% of goals are scored—and that the 136-second timer mirrors how long a striker possesses the ball during a match. In Blue Lock, every second and every decision matters. Ego praises Isagi for choosing to face stronger opponents and Bachira for trusting his instincts, calling them the kind of egoists Japan needs. Kira is expelled and leaves in disbelief, while Isagi struggles to process what just happened. Bachira tells him he passed him the ball because he “believed he would shoot.” Ego congratulates the remaining players for passing the entrance test, declaring them Team Z — the lowest-ranked but first official team of Blue Lock, made up of eleven players, including Isagi, Bachira, Kunigami, Igarashi, and others. Thus begins their true journey — to survive Blue Lock and become Japan’s ultimate striker.`

        "summary": `Team Z begins their daily training routine at Blue Lock, which includes endurance runs, jump tests, and various physical drills. The players push themselves hard, though exhaustion quickly sets in. Later during mealtime, most of the team heads to bed early, worn out from the intense regimen. However, Yoichi Isagi lies awake, too anxious and restless to sleep. His mind keeps replaying the previous game and the shock of Kira’s elimination. Unable to calm down, Isagi sneaks out to practice on his own, where he unexpectedly runs into Meguru Bachira. Seeing Isagi awake, Bachira invites him to a quick one-on-one match. While playing, Isagi finally asks the question that’s been bothering him — why did Bachira pass the ball to him during the tag game? Bachira smiles and gives a strange but honest answer: he felt something inside him — a “monster” — telling him to pass to Isagi because he sensed that Isagi also had a similar monster within. Bachira explains that this “monster” pushes him to play instinctively, to seek out those who share the same hunger and excitement for soccer. He admits that he’s glad he joined Blue Lock because it led him to meet Isagi, someone whose passion feels just as wild as his own. The next morning, Team Z is called together for a ranking announcement. Gurimu Igarashi’s rank jumps from #300 to #275, while Isagi’s moves from #299 to #274, surprising him and boosting his confidence. Jinpachi Ego then appears on the screen and explains Blue Lock’s structure. There are five strata in total, each containing five teams — from Team B at the top to Team Z at the bottom. Every group lives and trains under the same strict conditions, and rankings will keep changing based on performance. Ego concludes the session by announcing the start of the First Selection, marking the beginning of Blue Lock’s next brutal phase — where teamwork, rivalry, and ego will collide.`

Despite his talent, Sae openly expresses his disdain for Japanese football and claims that being on the national team doesn’t matter to him. He abruptly leaves the interview, showing no interest in Japan’s soccer scene. While renewing his passport, Sae stumbles upon a press conference for Blue Lock. Reporters bombard Anri Teieri and Hirotoshi Buratsuta with questions about the program’s realism and effectiveness. Confidently, Anri asserts that Blue Lock will fix Japan’s broken soccer system and create a hero capable of leading the nation to victory. Her boldness catches Sae’s attention, sparking his curiosity about the facility and its players. Meanwhile, the First Selection at Blue Lock is explained to the participants. It is a round-robin tournament among the five teams of the fifth stratum. Only the top two teams will advance to the Second Selection, but players can also qualify individually by becoming the top scorer or the most dominant player on their team. Rankings are based on points: 3 for a win, 1 for a draw, and 0 for a loss, with goal difference used to break ties. Team Z realizes they must cooperate strategically to have a chance of advancing, sparking debates over positions and roles. Back at the press conference, Anri speaks passionately about Japan’s football history — the near misses at the World Cup and the nation’s longing for a hero. She declares that Blue Lock is where this hero will be forged, a player who will take Japan to the top. Inspired by her words, Sae tells his manager to cancel all his plans — he wants to witness firsthand what kind of player Blue Lock can create. Thus, the stage is set for the next phase of Blue Lock, where ambition, teamwork, and individual brilliance will collide in the pursuit of greatness.`

        "summary": `Team Z decides player positions with a quick game of rock-paper-scissors. Yoichi Isagi wins and claims the forward position, placing himself at the center of the team’s strategy. Soon after, Jinpachi Ego appears on the TV screen to remind everyone about the First Selection — a round-robin tournament among five teams, where only the top two advance. Players can also survive individually by becoming their team’s top scorer. Ego announces that the first match, Team X vs Team Z, will start in two hours. Before the game, Team Z discusses tactics. They plan to focus their plays around Isagi, despite some doubt in his abilities. The team steels themselves and heads onto the field, ready to face their opponents. The match begins with Bachira in possession of the ball. Isagi struggles to break through Team X’s defense, trying to find an opening. In the chaos, Raichi, one of his teammates, takes the ball from him, followed by Kunigami, creating confusion. Team X takes advantage, but Isagi is surprised to see their players also ignoring teamwork — everyone is playing selfishly, focusing only on their own chances. The game quickly turns chaotic, with physical clashes breaking out among players. Amid the turmoil, Baro from Team X, ranked #250, breaks through and faces Isagi directly. As the chapter ends, Isagi realizes the stakes: he must stop Baro from passing, or Team Z will lose. The chapter sets up a high-pressure, ego-driven match that tests Isagi’s skills, instincts, and decision-making under chaos.`

Baro declares that he isn’t playing to make friends, claiming that his teammates exist only to make him shine and asserting himself as the true king, while Team Z falls into confusion and frustration—Igaguri blames the goalkeeper, Raichi criticizes Isagi for his performance as a forward and tells him to stick to defense, and Kuon tries to calm everyone. As the game resumes, Isagi attempts to connect with Bachira with a pass, but Igaguri intercepts and reminds him that Blue Lock’s first selection isn’t about which team wins or loses, but about showing the will to score goals. However, the ball is soon stolen by a Team X player, and seeing Team Z’s selfish and chaotic play, Team X decides to funnel all passes to Baro, exploiting their disarray and steadily increasing their lead. Isagi observes that leaving Baro unmarked ensures goals, but covering him opens space for others, making a comeback seem nearly impossible. The score climbs to 5-0 in Team X’s favor, and to turn the tide, Bachira suggests that he and Isagi must work together to score, prompting Isagi to resolve that he must become the foundation for Team Z, just as Baro is the foundation for Team X, embracing the responsibility to lead, create opportunities, and drive a potential comeback despite the overwhelming odds.`

Raichi, unmarked and in a better position, is furious at Isagi for not passing to him, while Baro derides Isagi as talentless, declaring that a striker who chokes in front of goal lacks what it takes.

The team grows chaotic with everyone focused on their own ambitions until Kuon scolds them, emphasizing that losing the next game could eliminate the whole team and that it’s not the time for selfish thinking. Chigiri contemplates the purpose of the First Selection, suggesting it’s meant to rebuild players’ foundations from scratch, while Isagi realizes it resembles a freestyle game, where chaos tests individual skills, which was exemplified by Baro becoming the foundation of Team X as his talent guided his teammates. Isagi concludes that Team Z needs a similarly overwhelming striker to carry the team toward victory, highlighting the importance of a top-notch striker for team success. Then, Ego appears on screen, confirming their conclusion, showing the match results and rankings—Team V first, X second, W third, Z fourth, Y fifth—and explaining the concept of a striker’s weapon: a unique skill or trait that disrupts opponents and dominates the field, tasking Team Z with discovering and refining their own weapons.`

This leaves Isagi and Chigiri, and while Isagi struggles to identify his weapon and asks for time, Chigiri refuses to reveal his, frustrating Raichi, who urges the team to move on. Taking the lead, Kuon strategizes that each player must fully utilize their weapons and introduces the “I’m the next 9” tactic, giving each member 10 minutes as striker to showcase their skills, followed by special training to unify Team Z and avoid the chaos of their previous selfish playstyle. Later, in the dining hall, Isagi eats natto and reflects on his potential weapon. Kunigami joins him, thanks him for the earlier pass, and reveals the Blue Lock goal-exchange system, where points for goals can be traded for rewards like steak, electronics, or a day off. Sharing his steak with Isagi, Kunigami asks why Isagi passed to him instead of Raichi, and Isagi admits it was an unconscious reflex.

Chigiri opts to remain defensive, showing no interest in attacking, so each striker gets 10 minutes to perform. Bachira goes first, easily breaking through using his solo style but is unexpectedly stopped when Niko steals the ball, prompting Isagi to realize that Team Y also has their own strategies. When Bachira’s turn ends, Kunigami becomes the striker, relying on teammates to bring him the ball while staying unmarked, but his shot is blocked and possession bounces between the teams.

To counter him, Team Z decides to assign two players to mark Okawa, while Isagi deduces that Team Y’s tactic is to wait for the perfect opportunity to strike. Meanwhile, Team Z continues their “I’m the next 9” strategy with Kuon as the next forward, attempting high passes to exploit Team Y’s defense, but the plan falters due to their strong defense. During the play, Kunigami is caught off guard by Niko, who steals the ball and passes it unexpectedly, leaving Isagi shocked as Niko avoids passing to Okawa. As minutes pass, Team Z’s chance of victory dwindles, and the halftime break shows players with mixed, mostly negative emotions. Chigiri questions the tactic’s effectiveness, angering Raichi, who criticizes him for hiding his weapon from the team, but Kuon steps in to calm the dispute, insisting the strategy is working, leaving Isagi to wonder if it’s the right choice. In the second half, Team X starts with the ball while Imamura takes the forward role but struggles to utilize his weapon, likening his effort to pursuing an out-of-league love like Team Y; his shot fails.

On the court, Niko confronts Isagi, explaining that if it weren’t for him, Okawa would have scored his second goal and sealed Team Y’s victory; he claims that although their eyes are the same, Isagi cannot outmatch him as he currently controls the game.

Kunigami praised Isagi for scoring the decisive goal, while Gagamaru asked if Isagi knew where the ball would go; Isagi admitted he simply ran toward the goal and that it might have been sheer luck. Bachira, however, explained that he intentionally passed to Isagi, seeing him clearly, and Kunigami suggested that Isagi’s weapon could be “goal scent,” though he remained uncertain. Later, unable to sleep, Isagi went to the monitoring room to rewatch his goal and found Chigiri there doing the same. Chigiri proposed that Isagi’s weapon might be spatial perception, allowing him to instantly recognize the field and create optimal plays. Curious about Chigiri’s weapon, Isagi pressed him to reveal it, and Chigiri reluctantly admitted that he had torn his ACL the previous year and feared reinjury, which made him suppress his full potential. Before his injury, Chigiri had experienced sleepless nights like Isagi, celebrating goal after goal, but the fear of losing his dream overpowered him.

While Keisuke was busy threatening Chigiri, Isagi seized the ball and encouraged Chigiri to ignore their warnings, reminding him that unlike Chigiri, he had no past to rely on and had come to Blue Lock to transform his life through football. Team Z passed the ball skillfully, culminating with Kuon receiving it and scoring a goal. Isagi reassured Chigiri that what mattered was not the past but who he was now, giving Team Z a 0-1 lead.`

Junichi, seemingly reluctant to score, made it easy for Kunigami to steal the ball, who then passed it to Bachira. Seeing Kuon open and unmarked, Bachira kicked the ball to him, and Kuon scored, bringing the score to 2-0. Thirty minutes into the first half, Team Z’s tactic placed Gagamaru, Raichi, and Naruhaya as forwards. When Junichi fouled Naruhaya by grabbing his jersey, Team Z earned a free-kick. Bachira executed it perfectly, sending the ball at a height favorable for Kuon, who headed it in for another goal, making it 3-0, with Kuon scoring all three goals. At halftime, Team Z’s locker room was filled with laughter and confidence, and Isagi felt the team growing stronger. The second half began with Raichi having the ball, passing it to Kuon, but Keisuke intercepted and, while drawing Iemon’s attention, passed to Junichi who scored, reducing the lead to 3-1. Kuon encouraged the team to stay calm, then passed to Isagi, but Junichi stole it again and scored, bringing the score to 3-2. Raichi chastised Kuon for being reckless, and Kuon apologized sincerely, yet Isagi noticed Kuon smiling cunningly after the opponents had scored twice, leaving him puzzled.`

Igaguri advises the team to hold the current score while attempting an additional goal as a precaution, but despite their efforts, Team Z fails to create a breakthrough. Amid the chaos, Isagi notices something strange in Team W’s defense and recalls Kuon’s earlier cunning smile, leading him to suspect betrayal. Hesitant but desperate, Isagi confronts Kuon, only for Keisuke and Junichi to confirm his fears: Kuon had secretly met with Team W before the match and revealed Team Z’s individual strengths and weaknesses under the excuse of taking a long bath, strategically ensuring that he could become Team Z’s sole survivor by scoring the most goals. The shocking revelation enrages Raichi, who impulsively tries to attack Kuon, resulting in a yellow card, and the players are forced back into their positions to resume the match. Calmly, Kuon explains that he sees Team Z’s victory as impossible and that bonds like teamwork are useless in Blue Lock, emphasizing that survival comes only from ego and self-interest. By leaking the team’s weapons, Kuon secures an arrangement with Team W to allow him to score three goals, guaranteeing he will be the team’s top scorer regardless of the outcome, and calls Isagi naive for believing otherwise. The team now faces a 12-versus-10 situation, with Team W in the lead 4-3, while Isagi and the others must grapple with the reality of betrayal, the fragility of trust, and the brutal nature of Blue Lock, where individual ambition can override any sense of teamwork.`

As Junichi kicks the ball toward the goal, threatening to widen Team W’s lead and make a comeback even more difficult, Isagi calls for Iemon’s help, who flicks the ball away from the net, creating a loose ball scenario with both teams scrambling for possession. Spotting Chigiri near the ball, Isagi shouts his name, prompting him to run, but Keisuke intercepts and tells Chigiri that this day will mark the end of his football journey, leaving Chigiri frozen to the spot, while Raichi yells at him to defend. A flashback reveals Chigiri’s past with Keisuke and Junichi, showing that the twins were known as the “double aces of Rajitsu Tech” while Chigiri, a rookie, focused not on their reputation but on making his own name. His incredible speed and precision quickly made him the top player in his school, even earning sports magazine features and interviews, and he replaced the twins as the key to the team’s success at nationals, much to their resentment. Chigiri had been playing football since age six, dedicating his life to the sport, believing his natural talent and weapon—his legs—would make him the world’s best striker, capable of scoring under any circumstance. However, in the middle of a game, he suffered an ACL tear, and though it was not severe, reinjury could permanently end his football career, earning him the moniker “the genius who fell” and ridicule from the Wanima brothers. After recovering, Chigiri played cautiously to protect his injury, moving slower than before, which Keisuke mocked as fear, though Chigiri’s true fear was losing football entirely, the core of his identity. Now, with the game in a critical moment and Team Z disadvantaged, Isagi, refusing to accept defeat, shouts at Chigiri to run, reminding him that the match is far from over, pushing Chigiri to overcome his fear and reclaim his resolve to fight for his dream on the pitch.`

Kuon approaches Isagi, telling him to give up and accept that victory is impossible with only three minutes left, fueling Isagi’s determination to prove him wrong. Ignoring his teammates’ inability to advance, Isagi attempts to break through alone, shocking Keisuke and the other Team W players who believed his sole weapon was spatial awareness. Despite his drive, Junichi blocks him, but Iemon, inspired by Isagi’s relentless spirit, rallies the rest of the team to support him. While observing Team Z’s desperate efforts, Chigiri initially feels they should concede defeat, but Keisuke mocks them, claiming their efforts are futile. Seeing Chigiri lost in thought, Isagi yells at him to focus on the ball, shoving him aside to clear the path, which angers Chigiri. However, as Chigiri watches Isagi fight with unrestrained passion, he realizes that Isagi mirrors his younger self—the Chigiri who believed he could become the world’s best striker, who devoted his life entirely to football with unshakable resolve. Witnessing Isagi’s intensity sparks both envy and anger in Chigiri, forcing him to confront the caution and fear that have held him back since his injury. In that moment, Chigiri decides to let go of his fears, resolving that if he risks further injury, it only proves he was unworthy before, and now he will fully embrace his potential to show the world who can be the ultimate striker. As he abandons his hesitations, Isagi senses the goal scent along Chigiri’s direction, realizing that together they can turn the tide of the match, reigniting Team Z’s chance for victory in the final minutes.`

Instead of kicking to Kunigami, he smells a goal emerging from Chigiri’s direction and instinctively passes to him, leaving the rest of Team Z momentarily confused as no one else is positioned to receive it. Keisuke and Kuon laugh at what they perceive as Isagi’s reckless mistake in such a critical moment, but Chigiri, sprinting at full speed, catches the ball and blazes past both Keisuke and Kuon, heading straight for the net. His unmatched speed makes him untouchable, and Isagi cheers him on, heart pounding with hope. Desperate to stop him, Keisuke tries to impede Chigiri physically, but Chigiri does not falter; he drives forward relentlessly. Now mere inches from Team W’s goalkeeper, Chigiri focuses everything on the shot, his legs refusing to give out despite the exhaustion and pressure, propelled by his vow to follow his dream and prove himself the world’s best striker.

Meanwhile, Kuon, having previously betrayed Team Z by leaking their strengths and weaknesses to Team W in order to secure himself as the team’s top scorer, was mercilessly confronted by Team W’s players for his actions, getting beaten and stepped on before narrowly escaping the chaos of the field, leaving the remaining members of Team Z to regroup and reflect on their resilience and teamwork. In the locker room, the team discussed their next formidable challenge: the undefeated Team V, realizing that without Kuon, they would have to rely entirely on each other’s abilities to survive and win, a task that seemed almost insurmountable given Team V’s flawless record. Unbeknownst to them, Kuon attempted to repeat his treachery by negotiating with Team V’s key players—Reo, Nagi, and Zantetsu—offering to leak Team Z’s strategies in exchange for being allowed to score freely in the upcoming match. However, the three rejected his proposition, citing their integrity and unwillingness to compromise their merit as players, with Nagi mocking Kuon’s desperation and suggesting that those who fail even after trying their best are weak and meant to lose. Observing this, Isagi could not let the mockery and undermining of his teammates go unchallenged; he stepped forward, introducing himself to the unfamiliar Team V members, defending the dedication and resolve of Team Z, and vowing that they would overcome Kuon’s treachery, the looming threat of Team V, and any obstacles in their path. The moment set the stage for a high-stakes battle where Team Z’s cohesion, individual growth, and sheer determination would be tested to their limits, underscoring the harsh realities of Blue Lock: talent alone is not enough, and survival requires both skill and unwavering commitment to one’s team.`

Iemon leads the discussion, updating Team Z on their current third-place ranking, with Team V, Team W, Team X, and Team Y holding first, second, fifth, and fourth positions, respectively, emphasizing the difficulty of their upcoming challenge. The focus quickly shifts to Team V’s key players: Zantetsu, Reo, and Nagi, who collectively scored 18 goals in previous matches, with Nagi being the top scorer at seven goals, and Iemon stresses that stopping this trio is essential for victory. The conversation briefly turns to Niko’s remarkable development, where Chigiri and Bachira reflect on how Niko has transformed from a player who relied on others to one who actively creates scoring opportunities, leaving Isagi both impressed and inspired. Meanwhile, in Team V’s locker room, Nagi is casually playing video games while Zantetsu and Reo exchange playful remarks about his lack of practice, highlighting their camaraderie and recognition of Nagi as a unique talent within the team. The narrative then delves into Reo’s backstory, revealing his upbringing in immense luxury as the heir to the Mikage corporation, with total assets of 705.8 billion yen, and his struggle to find meaning in a life where everything was easily accessible; this monotony ended when he discovered football, igniting a passion to prove himself capable in a field his father deemed beyond his reach. Reo’s determination to find his “gem” led him to an encounter with Nagi during their school years: Reo accidentally bumps into Nagi, whose quick reflexes and precision in catching a phone immediately astonish him, prompting Reo to recognize Nagi’s natural talent and invite him to play football together, to which Nagi agrees—but only under the condition of receiving payment—cementing the beginning of a partnership that would shape Reo’s ambition and Team V’s dynamic. This blend of strategic analysis, personal growth, and the forging of critical alliances sets the stage for the high-stakes confrontation between Team Z and the formidable Team V, where understanding the opponents’ strengths, leveraging one’s own abilities, and recognizing hidden potential will be crucial for survival and success in the Blue Lock program.`

The mood shifts as Imamura suggests a tactical meeting, which triggers Raichi’s unresolved anger toward Kuon for his past betrayal; Raichi attempts to strangle Kuon in his fury, with Igaguri and Naruhaya joining in, only to be stopped by Isagi, who argues that they need Kuon to survive and win against Team V, even if Kuon refuses to cooperate, emphasizing that missing a key player would doom Team Z. Kuon, now Team Z's top ranker, justifies his betrayal, explaining that after being let down by past teammates and their abandonment of their World Cup dreams, he chose survival over loyalty, intending to advance in Blue Lock regardless of Team Z’s outcome, which infuriates Raichi further. Kunigami, refusing to give up, challenges Kuon, asserting he can still score enough goals to surpass him, and Kuon, amused, reminds him that football cannot be played alone, revealing the philosophy behind his actions and the reason he prioritizes self-preservation in the cutthroat Blue Lock environment. 
        Bachira questions tie-breaking conditions if top strikers are equal in goals and yellow cards, and Ego appears on the screen to explain that standings in the Blue Lock ranking will ultimately decide such cases, showing Kuon as the highest-ranked player on Team Z despite his betrayal, angering Raichi, while emphasizing that goal-scoring alone dictates survival. Ego then introduces the critical concept of a striker’s “formula” for repeatable goals, urging Team Z to understand and master the key principles behind creating and finishing opportunities logically rather than relying on luck or undermining each other; he stresses that every world-class striker possesses a unique formula to score, which must be internalized by Team Z to secure victory, before disappearing from the screen. With only a day left before their match against Team V, Raichi threatens Kuon to abstain from playing under the pain of violent reprisal, and Isagi, still uncertain about his own abilities, heads to Team X’s training field to seek guidance from Baro, the fifth stratum’s top scorer, hoping to fully understand and refine his weapon to help Team Z survive the upcoming clash.`

Baro, amused by Isagi’s bold request, laughs and tells him that he isn’t skilled enough, but Isagi insists that Baro is the greatest player he’s met and that he wants to emulate his abilities. Amused, Baro agrees to a one-on-one demonstration, but Isagi is immediately caught off guard; glued to the floor and unable to move, he watches helplessly as Baro effortlessly scores a goal from his remarkable long-range accuracy. Baro, growing bored of Isagi’s persistence, dismisses him, declaring himself “the one true king” and leaving after showing the vast difference between their skills. Isagi, still determined, tries to analyze Baro’s technique and shooting range, only to realize that his earlier assumptions were off—Baro’s range extends to 27 meters, far beyond what Isagi imagined, prompting him to wonder if, by honing his own strengths and weapons, he could ever approach Baro’s level. Returning to Team Z’s room, Isagi continues to contemplate the methodology behind Baro’s formula for scoring goals, realizing he must develop his own unique formula to leverage his personal abilities, but he decides to focus on figuring it out during their next match instead of dwelling on it immediately. As he reflects, Isagi notices his own hands shaking, a physical manifestation of his fear of losing to the undefeated Team V, knowing that a defeat could mean the end of his football dreams. Igaguri, equally anxious, confides in Isagi about his fear of failure and the prospect of having to return to inherit his temple duties, revealing how deeply the pressure of Blue Lock weighs on them. Isagi, recognizing that their fear can be transformed into strength, reassures Igaguri and encourages him to channel it positively, and though shaken, Igaguri regains some confidence, declaring that Team Z will win no matter what, reinforcing the team’s determination and the high stakes awaiting them in their next challenge.

Kuon, undeterred, retorts that he has no interest in helping Team Z win and believes that as the team’s top scorer, he doesn’t need to risk anything to survive the first selection, leaving the team to reconcile their strategy without his participation. Meanwhile, Igaguri tries to steady himself, rationalizing that Team V might play less aggressively since they’ve already qualified for the next round, and Bachira comforts a nervous Isagi, urging him to focus on giving his best rather than fearing the end of his football career. As Team V enters the field, the match begins with Reo in possession, showcasing his exceptional dribbling skills. Isagi, aware of Team V’s tendencies from prior analysis, recognizes he cannot handle Reo alone and calls for Bachira’s assistance to intercept the ball. Reo, marked by two defenders, passes to Zantetsu to maintain possession, and Isagi predicts the next pass to Nagi, correctly anticipating Team V’s movements. Igaguri intercepts the pass, signals Isagi, and after a sequence of quick ball movement through Bachira and Gagamaru, Gagamaru attempts a header but misses, yet Isagi remains confident in their strategy. However, Team V immediately demonstrates why they are undefeated: Reo delivers a powerful, spinning pass, and Nagi, displaying extraordinary skill, traps the ball effortlessly and scores, leaving Isagi in awe and describing Nagi as a footballing monster. Observing Reo and Nagi’s fluid coordination and skillful execution, Team Z begins to feel the weight of the challenge, realizing that overcoming Team V will require not just strategy but extraordinary precision, teamwork, and mental fortitude to counteract the seemingly unstoppable prowess of their opponents.

Meanwhile, Isagi, still reeling from witnessing Nagi’s precision and power, begins to understand why Nagi holds the top rank in the fifth stratum, realizing that such skill cannot be dismissed as a fluke. As the game resumes, Team Z tries to adhere to their tactical plan, with Isagi passing to Kunigami, who moves closer to his shooting range, only to be blindsided by Reo, who has meticulously studied Kunigami’s every move and steals the ball, passing it to Nagi. Isagi and his teammates scramble, calling out Raichi and Igaguri to intercept, but Nagi traps the ball with ease and scores once again, leaving Isagi’s hope waning. Soon after, Isagi directs the ball to Chigiri, who races to intercept, but Zantetsu’s surprising speed allows him to steal the ball, passing to Reo, forcing Isagi to quickly organize a defense focused on preventing Nagi from receiving the ball, knowing that surrounding Nagi would leave other Team V players exposed. As Zantetsu finds himself unblocked and in his shooting range, he takes the shot and scores, pushing the score to 3-0 and crushing Team Z’s morale.

Zantetsu and Nagi, however, are surprised to see Bachira smiling and unaffected, wondering why he hasn’t been crushed by the scoreline. Isagi, equally confused, asks Bachira how he can stay so optimistic despite the dire situation, and Bachira explains that facing exceptional players like those on Team V actually fires him up, asking Isagi if he doesn’t feel the same and challenging him to embrace the fear and use it as fuel. Bachira recognizes Reo, Nagi, and Zantetsu as extraordinary, “super special” players, and declares that all he and Isagi have to do is elevate themselves to that same level to stand a chance at victory. The game resumes with Isagi passing to Bachira, who motivates him by saying that their usual weapons might fail, but surpassing their limits is the key to survival, and the monster inside him thrives on the desperation of those driven into a corner. Marked closely by Reo, Bachira surprises him with hyperspeed scissors, leaving Reo stunned and giving him the opportunity to advance.

Meanwhile, Isagi instructs Raichi to mark Reo, appealing to Raichi’s superior physique and ability, but Raichi, refusing to take orders, reluctantly agrees, threatening that failure will have dire consequences. Reo struggles to get past Raichi and is forced to pass to Zantetsu, who attempts to break through but is intercepted by Chigiri, who asserts his speed dominance. In a tense exchange, Zantetsu passes to Nagi, surrounded by Igaguri and Naruhaya, but Nagi cleverly positions himself and shoots, only to have Igaguri block the ball with his face. Bachira recovers possession, and when Reo marks him, Bachira confidently declares that the situation has changed and passes to Kunigami, signaling Team Z’s revival.

Imamura jokes that Kunigami had already surpassed his limits, which reminds Isagi of Bachira, who also pushed beyond his limits, motivating Isagi to begin shaping his own formula for scoring. Raichi then proclaims that it’s Team Z’s time to turn the tables, now trailing by only one goal, while at Team V’s locker room, Reo rallies his teammates, insisting they must strengthen their defense to maintain their lead. As the second half begins, Kunigami passes the ball to Bachira, who redirects it toward Gagamaru, but Gagamaru overshoots the ball and, to prevent Team V from stealing it, performs an acrobatic scorpion kick, nearly scoring until Zantetsu stops it. Imamura urges the team to retrieve the ball, and Isagi finds himself 22 meters from the goal, doubting his ability to score. Just as he tries to kick, a Team V player blocks his shot, and another appears from behind, stealing the ball. Raichi berates Isagi for failing to seize the opportunity, prompting Isagi to reflect that self-doubt achieves nothing and that evolving depends on honing his own skills rather than relying on others.

For the first time, Reo notices that Team Z has taken control of the field and can scarcely believe that he and Nagi might actually lose. Sensing Reo’s struggle, Nagi suddenly takes initiative, calling for the ball and surprising everyone, including Isagi, who had seen Nagi playing halfheartedly until now. Receiving Reo’s pass, Nagi glides past Igaguri and fires the ball to Zantetsu, who secures it and tries to continue Team Z’s momentum. Chigiri attempts to intercept but fails, allowing Zantetsu to return the ball to Nagi, who now seems to have experienced an awakening. Energized and exhilarated, Nagi manipulates the ball with precision, demonstrating newfound prowess, and scores, narrowing the lead to 4-3 in favor of Team V.

        "summary": `Team V is ecstatic after regaining the lead, but Team Z is reeling, shaken by Nagi’s sudden resurgence and the way he exploited every weakness they had left open. Igaguri trembles, aware that the game is slipping from their hands, and Isagi silently berates himself for the mistakes that allowed Nagi’s potential to awaken, realizing just how much danger Team Z is in with only fifteen minutes remaining. The pressure mounts on the entire team as they teeter on the edge of panic, and even the usually calm Gagamaru warns that if they fail to act decisively, the match is over for them. Kunigami wonders aloud how they can possibly counter Nagi, but Chigiri admits that his movements have become completely unpredictable, leaving Team Z grasping for any strategy that could turn the tide. Raichi, frustrated by their hesitation, barks orders to attack immediately, threatening that if all their efforts fail, he will exact brutal revenge, reminding them that as strikers, they are supposed to fight back no matter the circumstance. Across the field, Team V’s locker room is filled with confidence as Reo instructs Nagi to push for another goal to seal the victory, unaware that Team Z is preparing to respond. As the match resumes, Bachira takes the ball and passes it toward Chigiri, but Zantetsu quickly intercepts, ready to cut off the attack. Chigiri notes the difference between Zantetsu’s initial burst and his own top speed, realizing he has the edge in sustained acceleration, and just as both of them reach the ball, Nagi swoops in to claim it. To everyone’s surprise, Isagi positions himself between Nagi and the ball, calling him naive and successfully stopping him in his tracks, demonstrating his growing ability to read the field. Chigiri seizes the opportunity, retrieves the ball, and begins maneuvering past the defenders, while Zantetsu struggles to catch up. Reo desperately calls for support, trying to rally Team V, but Chigiri spots a gap in their defensive formation and takes his shot, only for the ball to hit the post. Gagamaru rebounds it immediately, attempting to score, but Reo manages to block the shot, buying a moment of tension and suspense. Kunigami, recognizing the perfect opening, positions himself within shooting range and strikes decisively, scoring a goal that ties the game at 4-4 and completely shifting the momentum. In the chaos of the play, Isagi observes everything unfolding as he had imagined, feeling the pieces of the field click into place in his mind. This moment solidifies his understanding that his eyes, his perception, and his ability to anticipate the flow of the game are becoming his true weapons, and he begins to grasp just how much control he can wield over the match if he trusts in his own instincts and analysis, setting the stage for Team Z’s resurgence against an opponent that had seemed insurmountable.`

        "summary": `Team Z is left in utter shock as Kuon, their normally composed top striker, grabs Nagi’s head in a desperate attempt to stop him, instantly altering the dynamic of the game. With only five minutes left and the score tied at 4-4, Team Z has been clawing back against the undefeated Team V, displaying remarkable teamwork and determination despite being down a player, but Nagi’s sudden awakening and superior skill had begun to tip the balance in Team V’s favor. As Zantetsu passes the ball to Nagi, Isagi rushes to intercept, but Nagi traps the ball effortlessly with his back, leaving Isagi frozen in awe and disbelief at the sheer level of his abilities, realizing just how far beyond ordinary talent Nagi operates. Nagi, unstoppable in his momentum, sprints past Isagi and moves directly toward Iemon, the last line of defense, while Team Z scrambles to organize a desperate block, shouting instructions and hoping someone can halt him before the culmination of all their efforts is lost. In a split second decision, Kuon lunges forward, grabbing Nagi’s head to physically impede him, and the arena is instantly thrown into chaos. The speaker rings, announcing that Kuon has been given a red card, ejecting him from the match and awarding Team V a free direct kick—an outcome that sends shockwaves through Team Z, leaving them stunned and unsure of how to proceed with only ten players and barely a minute remaining. Amid the confusion, Isagi, heart pounding, turns to Kuon, demanding to know why he risked everything in such a reckless act, but Kuon calmly explains that stopping Nagi, even at the cost of his own ejection, was the only way for Team Z to retain any chance of survival, revealing the depth of his commitment and the weight of the choices a player must make when their personal stakes in Blue Lock are at the highest level. Every member of Team Z is suddenly aware of the fragility of their situation; with only a minute left, the game has become a tense, high-stakes test of not just skill, but of courage, sacrifice, and the will to fight even when the odds seem insurmountable.

        "summary": `The tension on the field is suffocating as the last three minutes of extra time tick down, with both teams acutely aware that every move could determine their fate in Blue Lock. Reo, frustrated and confused by Kuon’s sudden interference, runs over to check on Nagi, who reassures him that he is fine, but the anger in Reo’s eyes is undeniable. Zantetsu quickly intervenes, warning Reo that another yellow card could eject him from the match, forcing Reo to reluctantly rein in his aggression while still bristling at the unexpected tactics of Team Z. Kunigami and Igaguri exchange bewildered glances, trying to comprehend Kuon’s decisive act, while Kuon himself remains calm and resolute, explaining simply that he did what was necessary. He reminds his teammates that, because of his sacrifice, Kunigami now has a clear path to prove himself as the top striker, but if Team Z fails to capitalize and the match ends in a draw, Kuon will be eliminated from the competition, his dreams hanging by a thread. With unflinching determination, Kuon urges his teammates to give everything they have in these final minutes, insisting that their victory is not just for the team, but for his chance to continue fighting to become the best striker in the world. The free-kick is awarded to Team V, and the pressure mounts as Reo steps up to take it. Behind the scenes, every player and observer understands that Kuon’s interference was the pivot that prevented Team Z from losing outright. Team Z braces themselves, determined to stop Reo by any means necessary, their entire focus honed on this one critical play. Iemon, observing from the sidelines, anticipates Reo’s decision, predicting that the ego-driven striker will attempt to score alone rather than pass to Nagi or Zantetsu. His prediction proves accurate as Reo strikes for the goal with full confidence, only to be thwarted by Iemon’s perfectly timed stop, sending the ball loose into the chaos of the field. Immediately, both teams converge, sprinting toward the ball with desperation and speed. Chigiri and Zantetsu, both lightning-fast, race to reach it first, but Zantetsu is slightly ahead and manages to kick the ball, only to have Raichi block him, causing the ball to fly unpredictably across the field. Nagi seizes the opportunity and recovers the ball, intent on scoring, but Team Z reacts instantly: Raichi, Igaguri, and Iemon position themselves to block every possible path to the net. Even so, Nagi’s strike threads through the defense, forcing Gagamaru to make a crucial save that keeps Team Z alive. The ball spills loose once more, and Isagi, heart pounding and adrenaline surging, finds himself in possession. With only seconds left, he knows instinctively that this is his last chance to alter the course of the game. Every thought, every calculation, every ounce of his skill converges in that instant as he prepares to act, aware that this single moment will define not just the match, but his future in Blue Lock.`

        "summary": `The atmosphere on the field is electric, tense, and brimming with anticipation as the final moments of the match draw near. Isagi, feeling the weight of the entire game on his shoulders, grips the ball with a mix of determination and clarity. He has trained himself to see the flow of the field, to predict every move of his teammates and opponents, and now, in this critical instant, that ability is being tested like never before. He recognizes Bachira, Kunigami, and Chigiri as the linchpins of the final play—the ones whose momentum and instincts will carry the ball forward, the players who can turn a precarious situation into a scoring opportunity. As Reo materializes in front of him, blocking his path and challenging his every thought, Isagi steels himself, affirming that this last play will be his moment, the one in which he will be the striker to deliver the finishing goal. Every breath, every step, every calculation leads him to a single, unwavering thought: he will score, and Team Z’s fate rests entirely on this move.

With almost flawless precision, Isagi begins the sequence he has envisioned countless times in his mind. He passes to Bachira, whose dribbling skills immediately tear through the opposing defense, drawing defenders toward him and forcing Team V to consider fouling just to halt his progress. Bachira’s eyes are locked on the field, and just as the defenders converge, he executes a perfectly timed pass back to Isagi, who then redirects the ball toward Chigiri. Chigiri, using his incredible speed, surges past the defenders, prompting Team V to swarm him in a desperate attempt to reclaim the ball. In an instant, Chigiri passes it back to Isagi, only for the realization to hit him that he was never the intended finisher—he has been a decoy, a catalyst for Isagi’s planned strike. Isagi sees the pattern unfold exactly as he predicted: the defenders move into position, the field opens in specific spots, and every teammate is exactly where he needs them to be. With 45 meters separating him from the goal and every variable aligning perfectly, Isagi knows that he has a clear path to score, his calculated strike only moments away from completion.

Meanwhile, Kuon watches intently from the sidelines, his mind a whirlwind of emotion. He did not intervene to commit a foul or to manipulate the game in favor of Team Z; rather, he sees something far more important unfolding before him—the unyielding fighting spirit of players who refuse to be defeated despite overwhelming odds. Kuon recognizes that there is a value in effort, in pushing beyond the simple survival instinct of Blue Lock, in actively shaping one’s destiny rather than passively observing it. His voice rises above the roar of the stadium as he shouts encouragement, pouring all his energy into cheering for Team Z, reminding them—and himself—that no one can claim victory by standing idly by.

Back on the field, the tension escalates as Isagi navigates the final stretch. With 35 meters remaining and two defenders closing in, he strategically passes to Kunigami, hoping to create an opening. But Zantetsu anticipates the move, intercepting the ball and preventing Kunigami from executing his mid-shot. The ball becomes a chaotic free object, bouncing across the pitch as both teams desperately vie for control. Raichi, ever vigilant, seizes the ball and quickly passes it to Bachira, signaling the continuation of Team Z’s last-ditch offensive. Isagi, his mind a map of the field, calculates every potential movement of Chigiri and Kunigami, identifying a precise spot—19 meters from the goal on the left flank—where he can isolate himself for a one-on-one with the goalkeeper. Bachira, understanding the gravity of the moment, places his trust fully in Isagi, committing to the plan with unwavering belief that this is their final chance. As the ball comes rolling toward him, Isagi braces himself, only to feel the sudden, jarring presence of Nagi standing in his path, and with that, the tantalizing scent of a goal—the one he had meticulously mapped out—vanishes in an instant, leaving the field in a moment of suspended anticipation and raw, nerve-wracking tension.`

        "summary": `The final moments of the match were a whirlwind of tension and strategy, with every second carrying the weight of Blue Lock’s brutal first selection. Isagi, facing Nagi directly in front of him, felt his meticulously calculated goal scent vanish in an instant. The path he had so clearly visualized—the trajectory of the ball, the positioning of his teammates, the opening in the defense—was suddenly blocked, leaving him paralyzed with disbelief. His mind raced: all he had to do was follow his goal scent and execute the shot, yet here was Nagi, standing as an immovable wall between him and the goal. Frustration surged through Isagi; he questioned why Nagi had appeared right at that critical moment, effectively neutralizing the future he had mapped out. The ball descended slowly, almost mocking in its approach, and Isagi knew he had to act quickly. Sprinting toward the unoccupied patch of field before Nagi could intercept, he felt a surge of doubt—he couldn’t replicate Nagi’s extraordinary trapping skills, his confidence wavered, and for the first time, the vision of Team Z’s victory seemed impossible. The field blurred as defeat began to creep into his thoughts, but in that split second, Isagi recalled all he had learned: every trap he couldn’t perform, every movement he couldn’t mimic, could be circumvented through his own unique formula. The realization struck him like lightning—he didn’t need to match Nagi’s ability; he needed to rely on his spatial awareness and precision.

With newfound clarity, Isagi executed a one-touch direct shot, bypassing the need for any elaborate trap or dribble. The ball cut through the defense and evaded Team V’s goalkeeper, landing in the net and giving Team Z the lead with a score of 5-4. Chigiri shouted for attention, Kunigami urged him to pass, but Isagi had already made his choice: this goal was his, and he would score it on his terms. In that instant, the missing piece of his personal puzzle—the piece that allowed him to translate vision into action—clicked into place. All his prior experiences, his understanding of his own strengths, and the lessons imparted by Ego converged. Isagi’s awakening was complete. He had unlocked his formula for success: relying on his instincts, his awareness of the field, and his direct approach to scoring, rather than trying to mimic others. Team Z had surged ahead against all odds, a team of underdogs defying expectation, their cohesion and resolve manifesting in the brilliance of a single, decisive moment.

On the sidelines and across the field, the shock was palpable. Reo, Zantetsu, and the rest of Team V could hardly process the defeat; the idea that their previously undefeated squad had been overtaken by a team operating at a numerical disadvantage was inconceivable. Reo, in particular, was paralyzed by disbelief, unable to reconcile the fact that his team had been bested. Nagi, ever analytical even in defeat, reminded Reo that there had technically been time to turn the match around, suggesting that scoring two more goals could have secured their victory. But the final buzzer sounded immediately after, cutting off any chance of recovery, and cementing Team Z’s improbable triumph. The field erupted with a mixture of jubilation and exhaustion, the underdog team having endured relentless pressure, executed flawless coordination, and witnessed Isagi’s critical awakening. Nagi, reflecting on the outcome, admitted his frustration—a familiar but humbling sensation—having done everything within his power yet still facing the bitter taste of defeat. Team Z’s victory was not just a win on the scoreboard; it was a testament to strategy, personal growth, and the power of believing in one’s unique abilities, forever marking a turning point in the annals of Blue Lock.`

        "summary": `The aftermath of Team Z’s incredible victory over Team V was a mixture of relief, exhaustion, and quiet reflection, as the adrenaline of the match slowly ebbed away. In the midst of the celebration, Kuon stood slightly apart, watching the team revel in their hard-earned win. Kunigami, noticing Kuon’s distant demeanor, called out and invited him to join the group, trying to pull him into the camaraderie. Kuon politely declined, insisting that he was fine, and even when Kunigami pressed him again, Raichi intervened sharply, telling Kunigami to stop. Raichi’s words carried weight—no one could erase the shadow of Kuon’s earlier betrayal, the act of grabbing Nagi’s head during the match, and Raichi admitted that he himself hadn’t yet forgiven Kuon. Yet, Raichi acknowledged the harsh truth: Kuon’s intervention had kept Team Z from losing. In a surprising twist, Raichi extended his hand to Kuon, a gesture of grudging respect, only to punch Kuon in the face just as he reached for it. The punch was not out of malice alone, but a symbolic clearing of the tension; Raichi declared that while he hated Kuon, he would move past his betrayal with a punch, and the rest of Team Z, including Igaguri, Imamura, and Iemon, silently agreed. Kunigami stepped in to help Kuon to his feet, extending a genuine invitation to celebrate together, and Kuon, humbled and apologetic, accepted.

As the buzzer rang to mark the end of the first selection, the results became official: Team Z had survived, and Team V, despite their loss, also advanced. Alongside them, the top strikers from Teams W, X, and Y would move forward, with Junichi Wanima scoring six goals, Ikki Niko four, and Shoei Baro ten goals, solidifying their positions as players to watch. Back in Team Z’s room, the team celebrated their survival and hard-fought victory. Drinks were requested, and Bachira and Isagi volunteered to bring some, using the brief respite to reflect on what had transpired. In the fifth stratum dining hall, while picking up water bottles, Isagi expressed his gratitude to Bachira for the pivotal pass that had led to his decisive goal. Bachira, ever modest and teasing, downplayed it, insisting that Isagi’s success was a result of his own skills. The conversation turned introspective as Isagi began to articulate his realizations: he had gained a deeper understanding of his unique weapon—his spatial awareness—and recognized a pattern in his scoring: nearly all of his goals had come from one-touch shots. The insight crystallized for him the concept of his personal formula, a synthesis of prediction, positioning, and execution that would define his growth as a striker. Bachira, observing Isagi’s earnestness, laughed and encouraged him, jokingly chanting “ego” to lighten the mood and teasing him with playful gestures, high fives, and fake-out chops, reinforcing both camaraderie and confidence.

Their moment of levity was tempered by the somber sight of other players outside, crying over their elimination, a stark reminder of the ruthless nature of Blue Lock. In the midst of this, Niko appeared, congratulating Bachira and Isagi on Team Z’s victory and personally addressing Isagi. Niko admitted that watching Isagi’s goal had forced him to rethink his own approach during the match, inspiring him to aim for self-improvement and solidifying his place in Blue Lock. He challenged Isagi, promising not to lose next time, and Isagi, understanding the mutual dependency of their growth, accepted Niko’s challenge with equal determination. Bachira couldn’t help but tease Isagi for his newfound popularity, injecting humor into the otherwise intense reflection. Finally, carrying the drinks requested by Kuon, Bachira and Isagi returned to Team Z’s room, only to find their exhausted teammates asleep on the floor, worn out from the match and the celebration alike. The victory, while exhilarating, was just one step; ahead lay even greater challenges, and Team Z knew that their journey in Blue Lock had only just begun.`

        "summary": `Survivors of the first selection brace themselves for the grueling trials that lie ahead, while in Team Z's room, Raichi erupts in frustration, yelling at the monitor and demanding answers from Ego about why the second selection will not commence immediately. Ego calmly explains that there will be a delay before the next trial begins and, to make productive use of the waiting period, all players will undergo intense physical training—strictly without handling the ball under any circumstances. Soon after, Iemon and Igaguri join Raichi in venting their frustrations, only to be reminded by Ego not to let arrogance cloud their judgment, as their team currently ranks lowest across the entire facility. The warning is clear: training will continue until Ego decides otherwise. The ensuing physical regimen proves merciless, combining two-hour endurance drills, extreme trunk exercises, weight training, and sprints, with dinner breaks offering little relief as most players, including Isagi and Naruhaya, are too exhausted to eat. Days stretch into a punishing cycle of exertion, with some players pushing themselves to the point of vomiting from sheer fatigue. Finally, after ten grueling days, Ego announces that the first selection has concluded across all of Blue Lock’s strata and instructs the survivors to don their training suits and head to the basement of their respective stratum, sparking ecstasy in Team Z as their relentless ordeal comes to an end, bringing them one step closer to their dream of becoming the world’s best striker. Ego greets his so-called “unpolished gems,” commending their perseverance, before revealing a shocking truth: none of the previous strata—the first through fourth—actually existed. In reality, all players had been competing within what was essentially the fifth stratum, a deception designed to make them believe they were at the bottom so they would push themselves to the extreme. Some players react with anger, feeling betrayed by Ego’s manipulation, but he defends his approach, asserting that by breaking down their soft hearts and misleading them, he instills a ruthless, goal-driven mindset necessary to cultivate world-class strikers. With that revelation, Ego declares the official start of the second selection, marking the beginning of an even more intense phase of Blue Lock’s unforgiving program.

Now, with the cutting-edge training facilities at their disposal, they have the opportunity to progress from level 1 to level 100, reaching new heights in their abilities. Ego outlines the structure of the second selection, explaining that it consists of five stages, and only those who successfully clear all stages will pass. Furthermore, he reveals that those who survive the second selection will earn the chance to compete in a training match against some of the world’s top footballers, a reward that ignites both excitement and anxiety among the players. With the announcement concluded, Ego declares that entry into the second selection is entirely up to each player, emphasizing that only those who are mentally prepared may step forward, and that for the first stage, participants must enter individually, separating themselves from their teammates.

As the screen fades, most players hesitate, uncertain about attempting the first stage, until an unfamiliar figure confidently approaches, picking up two balls. With precise skill, he launches the first ball in a tall, gentle curve, followed by a second low-curved shot, and astonishingly, the two balls collide midair. Witnessing this display, Isagi is left dumbfounded, struggling to comprehend the talent before him. The mysterious player walks to the gate and announces that he is ready, and upon entering, his name appears: Rin Itoshi. The revelation sparks curiosity and whispers among the players—Igaguri initially wonders if Rin is one of the famed Itoshi top 11 players, only to be corrected by Imamura, leaving everyone questioning who Rin truly is. Rin’s seamless completion of the first stage immediately establishes him as the benchmark, causing Team Z to reflect on their own positions, with many doubting themselves in comparison.

Sensing the moment, Isagi steps forward to rally his teammates, reminding them of their own strengths and the victories they had achieved together, particularly their win against the so-called undefeated Team V. Each member of Team Z chimes in, recalling their individual contributions: Igaguri praises his crucial block against Nagi, Kunigami boasts about his remarkable goal, Bachira highlights his dribbling, Chigiri credits his speed, Raichi and Imamura acknowledge their defensive prowess, Kuon references his strategic red card, Naruhaya laughs at Kuon’s antics, Gagamaru notes his support, Iemon celebrates his critical save, and Isagi himself emphasizes his own goal. This mutual recognition bolsters their confidence, and together, they vow to reunite after the first stage.

Minutes later, Isagi steps through the gate, bidding farewell to Bachira, and declares his determination to grow stronger. He finds himself in a square room lined with panels, a sense of uncertainty washing over him, until one panel opens, delivering a ball into his hands. Still perplexed by the scenario, Isagi’s attention is drawn to a suddenly appearing hologram, leaving him both intrigued and apprehensive about the trials that await in the first stage of the second selection.

        "summary": `Isagi stands frozen in the center of the square room, his eyes fixed on the hologram before him, trying to make sense of its purpose. Gradually, he notices that the panels behind the hologram reflect a goal net, and his attention shifts to the image projected on the ground, which is slowly shrinking in size. Realization dawns on him: this room is simulating a soccer scenario, specifically a situation where a player is positioned directly in front of the goalkeeper. Without stepping outside the boundaries of the projected area, he must score goal after goal to succeed. Determined, Isagi takes his first shot, only to be stopped mid-kick by a holographic goalkeeper, leaving him stunned at the skill programmed into the simulation—he muses that a normal high schooler would never be able to react that quickly.

Looking up, Isagi spots a screen displaying a timer and the number of goals he must score: 100 goals in under 90 minutes to clear the stage. The first stage, he realizes, is a test of ego and self-reliance, challenging players to depend solely on their individual skills in front of the goal. Soon, a panel opens, releasing a ball, and Isagi instantly evaluates its trajectory and speed. With precise movement, he positions himself correctly and delivers a powerful, direct shot. Minutes pass, and he manages to score 30 goals, leaving 70 more to reach within 72 and a half minutes. The difficulty escalates as multiple holographic defenders appear, mimicking real-game scenarios, and Isagi struggles against the exponentially increased challenge, his previous strategy no longer sufficient.

Meanwhile, Anri and Ego observe the stage through a monitoring system. Ego explains to Anri the inner workings of the Blue Lockman simulation: microsensor chips embedded in the balls interact with the holograms to create realistic physical reactions, a technology he calls holographic sports. When Anri protests about funding, Ego dismisses her and emphasizes that the first stage is designed to test each player individually. Unlike the first selection, where teamwork could carry some players, this stage demands personal skill and initiative, pushing those who relied on others to their limits. However, for players who embrace the challenge, it becomes an opportunity to transform their “0” into a “1,” cultivating talent and advancing as strikers capable of reaching the next dimension. Back in his square room, Isagi steels himself, resolving that in this crucible, he will evolve and grow stronger than ever before.

        "summary": `The second level of the first stage in the second selection begins, and Isagi immediately tries to assess his surroundings, carefully observing the holograms and the ball to find an opening. With heightened focus, he positions himself and kicks, successfully scoring a goal. Buoyed by this small victory, Isagi gains confidence, believing he has the potential to clear the round. The screen in the room reminds him of the challenge ahead: 52 goals to score in just 48 minutes and 20 seconds. Meanwhile, in the monitoring room, Anri remarks on the players’ steady improvement and praises the sophistication of the training design. Ego, however, tempers her excitement, noting that the first part of the stage has only just begun.

Back in the square room, Isagi’s pace is steady, having cleared 12 goals in just over six minutes, leaving 40 more to go. Suddenly, a speaker blares and the screen shifts from the second level to the maximum level. The defending targets begin moving unpredictably, and the balls he receives are slower yet unspinning, making accurate shooting significantly more difficult. In the monitoring room, Ego explains to Anri that the maximum level simulates high-level passes with random directions and speeds, designed to test shooting precision, stamina, and spatial awareness—skills essential for elite-level strikers. Those who lack these abilities will be unable to clear the stage.

Isagi struggles initially, realizing he is accustomed to the easy, precise passes of his teammates—Bachira’s soft passes, Kunigami’s blocking assistance, and Chigiri’s positioning for backup plays had always supported him in past games. For the first time, Isagi acknowledges that he has never truly fought on his own. Determined to rely solely on his own skills, he focuses on honing his awareness and spatial analysis. He studies the positions of the targets and the goalkeeper, calculates the trajectory and spin of the ball, and times his shot precisely. His first attempt is blocked, the ball failing to follow the exact path he envisioned. Recognizing the challenge, Isagi adjusts his technique, aiming for the ball’s impact point with perfect timing. This time, his direct, precise shot overwhelms the holographic goalkeeper, scoring a goal. Through this success, he discovers a reliable formula: by combining his spatial awareness with a perfectly timed direct shot, he can score consistently on his own. With this realization, Isagi notes that he is learning new aspects of his own potential.

Observing from the monitoring room, Anri comments on Isagi’s rapid improvement, and Ego notes that human behavior naturally adapts under pressure, suggesting that Isagi is experiencing an evolution in real-time. Back in his room, the speaker signals completion as the screen resets to zero goals—Isagi has successfully cleared the first stage of the second selection. He then walks toward the waiting room for the next stage, where the overhead screen instructs the players that they must proceed in teams of three, signaling a shift from individual trials to a cooperative challenge.

While observing, he spots Nagi and Reo, deducing that they must have stayed behind, likely waiting for Zantetsu. Suddenly, a voice calls his name—Bachira has just completed the first stage and approaches him, noticing the screen’s message as well. Bachira asks Isagi who will fill the final slot in their three-man team. Isagi is initially confused, but Bachira explains that with just the two of them accounted for, they need one more member. Though surprised that Bachira assumed they would team up automatically, Isagi doesn’t mind. He suggests Kunigami or Chigiri as the third member, and Bachira agrees, proposing that they pick whoever finishes the first stage first. Isagi nods in agreement, and the plan is set.

Their discussion is interrupted when Nagi, accompanied by Reo, approaches and invites Isagi to join their team. Both Isagi and Bachira are shocked. Reo questions Nagi’s choice, doubting if Isagi is the right fit, but Nagi remains steadfast, citing Isagi’s performance in the Team Z versus Team V match as impressive and expressing his desire to play alongside him. Isagi politely declines, emphasizing that he and Bachira are already a team. Nagi respects this decision but surprises everyone by offering to join Isagi and Bachira instead, leaving Reo behind. Reo reacts with frustration, asking Nagi about his plan, to which Nagi explains that their defeat against Team Z left him frustrated and eager to understand that feeling firsthand by playing with their former opponents. For the first time, Nagi expresses a genuine willingness to exert effort in soccer, while Reo reluctantly accepts his decision. Isagi, torn between his trust in Kunigami and Chigiri and his desire to play with Nagi, ultimately invites Nagi to join their team, and Bachira agrees. The trio then heads toward the gate for the third stage, with Nagi waving goodbye to Reo, promising to wait for him.

As they exit the waiting room, Bachira fist bumps Nagi, joking about counting on him, and Nagi reciprocates. Bachira remarks on Nagi’s seemingly cold-hearted choice to leave Reo behind, and Nagi admits feeling lonely but insists that following his ego is key to surviving Blue Lock. He also notes that Isagi and Bachira’s team seems more intriguing. The three continue down the corridor until they arrive at the next waiting room for the third stage. Here, Isagi notices only three other players, one of whom is Rin Itoshi—the player who had stunned everyone with his skill before the first stage. Suddenly, the screen flashes Ego’s face, announcing that the third stage will be a 3 vs 3 team battle. Isagi’s heart races as he realizes that they might face Rin right away, filling him with both excitement and apprehension.

        "summary": `Kunigami has just completed the first stage of the second selection and enters the assembly area for first-stage clearers, immediately spotting Chigiri. The two greet each other warmly, exchanging congratulations on clearing the stage. Kunigami notes that Chigiri seems to be the only familiar face around, to which Chigiri replies that Isagi, Bachira, and Nagi have already moved ahead. Kunigami feels a twinge of irritation at this news, and Chigiri acknowledges his frustration. Quickly, Chigiri proposes that they team up, and Kunigami readily agrees. Now, their task is to find the third member to complete their three-man team.

Meanwhile, in the third stage area, Ego addresses the players, explaining the mechanics of the upcoming mini-game. Each match will consist of two teams of three, ending when one team scores five goals. Each goalkeeper will be a Blue Lockman hologram, adding an extra layer of challenge. The stage carries a unique twist: the winning team gains the right to choose one player from the losing team, who will then join them, creating a four-man team, while the losing team must return to the previous stage. This process repeats until the fifth stage, at which point each team will have five players. Ego dubs this sequence of matches “the rivalry battle,” emphasizing both strategy and adaptability.

Following the explanation, Ego announces updated rankings based on the order players cleared the first stage: Isagi is ranked 15, Bachira 16, and Nagi 7. With his briefing complete, Ego disappears from the screen. Nearby, Rin Itoshi’s team discusses the third stage. Aoshi Tokimitsu is nervous, worried about being chosen if they lose, while Jyubei Aryu dismisses weaker opponents like Isagi as unworthy of his attention, insisting they should aim to compete against higher-ranked players. Rin silences Aryu, stating that he only cares about winning quickly and advancing, and that he teamed up with Tokimitsu and Aryu simply because the stage requires a three-man team. Rin reveals a striking mindset: to him, everyone in Blue Lock is merely a stepping stone, and his ultimate motivation is fueled by his desire to surpass and crush Sae Itoshi.

Upon hearing this, Isagi is stunned to realize that Rin is the younger brother of the renowned midfielder Sae Itoshi. Bachira laughs at Rin’s blatant ego, while Nagi comments on how eccentric their team has become. Isagi, recognizing the strength of Rin’s team but driven by his own competitive spirit, decides that they must play against them. He invites Rin’s team to face off, and Bachira and Nagi quickly agree. Rin, maintaining his indifferent yet confident demeanor, consents as well, stating that any opponent is fine. With all six players on board, the teams step forward and enter the third stage of the second selection, ready for the intense 3 vs 3 battle that awaits.

        "summary": `The match between the two teams kicked off on a compact 30 by 40-meter mini-field, with Blue Lockman goalkeepers stationed in front of each net. Isagi, Bachira, and Nagi made up Team White, represented by a white Blue Lockman. As the game began, Isagi controlled the ball and quickly passed it to Bachira. Aryu assigned Tokimitsu to guard him, but Bachira executed a sharp scissors kick, slipping past Tokimitsu with ease. Approaching Rin, Bachira chose instead to pass to Nagi, who rushed forward to receive it. Aryu moved to intercept, but the pass turned out to be intended for Isagi, who dashed into position in the corner. With a perfectly timed direct shot, Isagi scored, beating the Blue Lockman and putting Team White ahead 1-0. Elated, the trio huddled and celebrated, with Nagi and Bachira praising Isagi’s growth since the start of the second selection, boosting his confidence and reaffirming their belief in Team White’s strength.

The opposing team reacted differently: Tokimitsu panicked, Zantetsu complimented the goal as stylish, but Rin remained unfazed, deeming their efforts lukewarm. Rin boldly declared that, for some present, football was merely a sport—but for him, it was a battlefield. He then tilted his body and struck a long-range goal from the kickoff, spinning the ball perfectly to bypass both Nagi and Bachira, who were frozen in place, and the Blue Lockman. The score quickly leveled to 1-1, leaving Isagi in awe at Rin’s skill. Nagi questioned Bachira about the legality of scoring from that position, and Bachira confirmed it, noting its low probability of success. Tokimitsu and Aryu were stunned, while Rin coldly dismissed teammates and opponents alike as insignificant obstacles, merely stepping stones on his path to his goal. He even declared the game a waste of time, challenging the others to end it.

Rin’s arrogance prompted Isagi to confront him directly. He reminded Rin that, like him, he was risking everything for his goals and had joined Blue Lock with the same ambition. Rin countered, explaining that goals were far from lukewarm; to him, losing in soccer equated to losing one’s very reason for existence—a death in its own right. For Rin, football was a life-or-death battle. The intensity of his words shocked the other players, but Isagi quickly let go of the initial shock and embraced his own ego. He declared to Rin that the casual match was over and that the field had now become a deadly battlefield, fully committing himself to the clash ahead.

        "summary": `Rin Itoshi casually tosses the ball into the air, smirking as he tells Team White to continue so he can put an end to their “mediocre playtime.” Nagi looks on, puzzled by Rin’s attitude, thinking it’s just a game of football, while Bachira mutters that Rin is outright rude. Isagi, however, is intrigued, observing Rin’s mindset with keen interest. The score remains 1-1, and Team White has possession. Isagi passes to Bachira and internally reminds himself that, no matter how extraordinary Rin is individually, this is still a 3v3 match. He approaches Rin, determined to make him regret underestimating them.

Bachira notices Rin guarding Isagi and quickly lofts the ball toward Nagi, but Jyubei Aryu intercepts with a remarkable high jump and controlled headbutt, sending the ball to Aoshi Tokimitsu. Bachira rushes Tokimitsu, slightly deflecting the pass, and Isagi attempts to gain control of the ball, only to be pressured by Aryu. Using his superior reach, Aryu kicks the ball through Isagi’s arms, scoring a goal and putting Team Red ahead 2-1. Isagi is stunned, realizing that Aryu’s reach and jumping ability allowed him to steal the ball and score from such an improbable position. He internally notes Aryu’s explosiveness and unusually long limbs, thinking his body seems almost against the rules. Aryu, ever confident, declares himself the most stylish player on the field. Isagi apologizes for letting him score, and Bachira reassures him, acknowledging that facing such strength proves they are worth beating.

As the game resumes, Isagi passes to Bachira, seeking a way to attack. Seeing Nagi tightly marked, Bachira decides to dribble himself. Tokimitsu, standing nervously in front of him, is unsure of how to respond. Bachira attempts to bypass him, only for Tokimitsu to suddenly lunge and pressure him. Despite Bachira’s skill, Tokimitsu reacts quickly, intercepts, and steals the ball. Isagi notes the surprising contrast: Tokimitsu may start slow, but his explosive speed and agility place him on a completely different level. Tokimitsu charges forward, his singular focus on scoring, darting past Isagi with a bullet-like burst of power. He reaches the goal and fires a devastating shot, raising the score to 3-1. Immediately after scoring, Tokimitsu’s self-doubt and timidness resurface, but Rin and Aryu acknowledge the weapon-like potential he displayed.

Isagi realizes that Rin is far from the only threat on Team Red; each of their top players possesses insane individual skills. Even more impressive, Team Red operates almost entirely independently, lacking coordination, yet they dominate Team White, whose members work in complete sync. Facing this, Isagi senses the daunting gap between himself and the Top 3, fearing that their current performance will lead to defeat. At that moment, Nagi breaks the tension, calling out how amazing the Top 3 are and declaring football fascinating. Inspired by Isagi, Nagi announces that it’s now his turn to make the game interesting, signaling a shift in Team White’s approach.

        "summary": `The chapter opens with an epic cover, immediately setting the intensity for the match. Seishiro Nagi, Yoichi Isagi, and Meguru Bachira huddle together, discussing a plan to counter the Top 3—Rin Itoshi, Jyubei Aryu, and Aoshi Tokimitsu. Bachira ties his shoes, nodding in agreement with Nagi’s idea, acknowledging that Nagi wants to play the way he finds interesting. Isagi also concurs, noting that this approach could be the best way to take on the overwhelming power of the Top 3. Nagi admits that this is his first time devising a plan, driven purely by the frustration of losing, emphasizing that soccer isn’t fun unless he wins. With their strategy decided, the match resumes, Team Red leading 3-1.

Isagi passes to Bachira while Nagi is tightly marked by Aryu, and Bachira is pressured by Tokimitsu. Their plan relies on coordinated, one-touch triangle passing to circumvent individual mismatches, knowing that attempting to go solo would guarantee failure. Bachira passes to Nagi, who immediately returns it to Isagi, and they continue cycling the ball in a tight triangle, gradually advancing toward the goal. When Bachira finally receives the ball near the penalty area, Isagi makes a move to score—but Rin intercepts, calling it a “lukewarm hotline.” Bachira quickly reacts, sending a high-speed ground pass to Nagi, whose lazy genius shines as he performs a back-heel trap, spins past Aryu, and shoots, scoring a brilliant goal.

Afterward, Nagi explains that the goal wasn’t fully planned—though the previous passes allowed him freedom, this particular sequence “pushed an idea straight into his brain.” Bachira jokes about sending more ideas Nagi’s way, which Nagi agrees to, casually asking how many more goals are needed. Isagi observes and analyzes the play, realizing that their triangle passing, combined with his movements, Bachira’s inspiration, and Nagi’s instinctive reactions, constitutes a unique style of soccer—**their soccer.**

While the trio exchanges words, Rin interrupts, chastising them for chatting mid-match and immediately attempts a straight kick from kickoff. The shot almost scores, but Isagi blocks it with his head. This moment crystallizes a new understanding for Isagi: he can control the field with his awareness, sensing danger before it happens. Locking eyes with Rin, Isagi confidently mutters, “That was lukewarm,” signaling that he’s no longer intimidated and fully stepping into his own presence on the battlefield of the pitch.

        "summary": `The chapter opens with Yoichi Isagi boldly declaring that he has already shattered the specialties of the Top 3 and that from now on, he will control the battlefield. The intensity immediately spikes as the VAR announces that the Red Team will have possession and will start with a corner kick. Rin Itoshi steps up to take the kick, while Seishiro Nagi marks Jyubei Aryu and Meguru Bachira covers Aoshi Tokimitsu. Isagi positions himself strategically between Nagi and Bachira, ready to react to whichever direction Rin decides to pass. In his mind, Isagi plans to launch a counter immediately to intercept the ball.

However, Rin surprises them all by sending the ball high into the air with an exaggerated curve. Isagi initially thinks the pass is directed at Aryu, but the ball arcs even higher and spins violently. Before anyone can react, Rin executes a vertical spinning direct shot straight from the corner kick, scoring a goal and changing the scoreboard to 4-2 in favor of the Red Team. The unexpected precision leaves everyone, especially Isagi, stunned. He silently contemplates his choices and reflects on how, had circumstances been slightly different, he could have intercepted the goal. Bachira points out the immediate danger: if the Red Team scores one more goal, they win. Nagi, ever the strategist, counters with a bold calculation—if they score three goals, victory is theirs—and Isagi nods, realizing it’s time to fully lock in and execute their plan.

The trio resumes their triangle passing formation, moving the ball with precision and speed toward the goal, aiming to trigger a chemical reaction and create a scoring opportunity. As their coordinated movement progresses, Rin approaches Isagi from behind, signaling that he is done playing around. With calm efficiency, Rin scores again, putting the Red Team ahead 5-2. Now, with the match tipping decisively, the teams face the crucial moment of deciding which player to steal, adding another layer of tension to the ongoing battle.

        "summary": `The intense 3v3 battle concludes with a decisive victory for Team Red, and Aryu and Tokimitsu immediately decide to steal Bachira, leaving him behind. Rin and his teammates move ahead without a glance back, while Bachira stands momentarily emotionless, then calmly tells Isagi that if he wants him back, he’ll obey—essentially placing himself in Isagi’s hands. With that, Isagi and Nagi descend to the floor of the second stage. As they step onto the new level, Nagi casually suggests checking out the rest rooms, but Isagi, fully focused, declines, insisting there’s no time to rest. He emphasizes the danger of losing again, pointing out that Nagi might be the one picked due to his own perceived incompetence in isolation. This sparks a heated argument between the two, with Nagi yanking Isagi’s hair and warning him that continuing with such self-doubt will distort his ideals.

Their confrontation escalates as they clash over reliance and strength, with Isagi boldly claiming that Nagi is helpless without Reo, while Nagi retorts that Isagi is equally dependent on Bachira. In a moment of frustration and determination, Isagi shoves Nagi away, declaring that he intends to prove he can fight and succeed on his own. This sparks a realization in Nagi, who points out that unlike the first selection, where one person’s brilliance could carry the team from “0” to “1,” the reduced field size and fewer players in the second stage magnify the significance of each individual action. Isagi agrees, understanding that survival now depends on winning in one-on-one situations.

Nagi then asks how to shake off the feeling of frustration, to which Isagi simply replies that winning is the only way. As they approach the doors of the second stage, Baro appears, hopping along the path in search of strong opponents. Drawing on the insight of the “monster” within him, Isagi formulates a plan: he will face Baro head-on and attempt to defeat him one-on-one, fully embracing the challenge and the brutal individual nature of the second stage.

        "summary": `The chapter opens with Isagi fully aware of the stakes: failing to defeat Baro means they’ll never progress further in the second stage. As Baro aggressively tries to push past them, Nagi provocatively asks if he wants to play against him, hinting that they might be able to defeat Baro. This angers Baro, who still sees himself as a king despite his descent, a point Nagi highlights to provoke him further. While Isagi attempts to calm the tension, Naruhaya appears through the doors and greets them. Curious, Isagi asks if Naruhaya was on Baro’s team, to which Naruhaya confirms. He explains that Baro scored four goals himself, but his selfish playstyle disrupted the team’s harmony, causing them to lose—and ultimately leading to Nishioka being stolen. Baro disagrees, blaming his teammates instead. Naruhaya tries to pacify him, warning him not to rush into battle, knowing that another loss would be disastrous. Baro declares he will neither run nor hide and threatens to crush them anytime. Both Baro and Naruhaya then move into a separate rest area, while Isagi and Nagi retreat to their own, contemplating strategies for one-on-one battles. Nagi decides to call it a day, saying they’ll think it through tomorrow, and Isagi agrees.

The following day, while eating lunch, Isagi and Nagi observe the other teams that have lost. They begin strategizing, considering which team would provide the best challenge to improve their skills and prepare them for facing Rin and the others. Later, as Isagi trains, he reflects on the previous matches and realizes that to have a chance against Rin and the top three, he must experience Baro’s strength firsthand. Just then, Naruhaya comes onto the field, seeking out Isagi. He warns that if they lose again, none of them will get picked due to their inability to handle one-on-one situations and urges Isagi to take on Baro. Faced with this challenge in the open, Isagi recognizes that refusal isn’t an option, and the match against Baro is officially confirmed.
